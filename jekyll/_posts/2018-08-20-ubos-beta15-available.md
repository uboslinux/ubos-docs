Two important conferences are coming up:

* the <a href="https://nextcloud.com/conf/">Nextcloud conference</a> in Berlin,
  Germany, from August 23 to 30, and
* the <a href="https://mydata2018.org/">MyData.org conference</a> in Helsinki,
  Finland, August 29-31.

We'll be at both, and just in time, we are proud to release UBOS beta 15!

Here are some highlights:

* Boot your Raspberry Pi from USB, not just an SDCard
* The UBOS Staff has learned a very convenient new trick
* UBOS now drives the LEDs on Intel NUCs and the Desktop Pi enclosure for the Raspberry Pi
* Access your device from the public internet through Pagekite integration

As always, we love your <a href="/community/">feedback</a>.
