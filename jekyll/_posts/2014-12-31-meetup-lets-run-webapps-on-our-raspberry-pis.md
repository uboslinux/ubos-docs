UBOS Beta 1 is here, and that means installing web apps on our Raspberry Pi's has become as simple as executing
a single command:

~~~~~
    ubos-admin createsite
~~~~~

For this hands-on meetup, bring your Raspberry Pi's, and we will get one or more web apps running on it. Your choices currently are:

• ownCloud -- file sharing, calendaring, address book sharing

• Known -- modern decentralized social media

• Wordpress -- blogging and content management

• Mediawiki -- the wiki that Wikipedia runs on

• Selfoss -- RSS reader

• Shaarli -- URL shortener and bookmarking app

<b>What to bring</b> (if you have it, it's fine to come without):

• Raspberry Pi model B or B+ (Ethernet). Alternatively bring a PC that can boot from a USB stick.

• Suitable SD Card or Micro SD Card that works with your Raspberry Pi. 4G minimum.

• Keyboard and monitor, plus cables and power supply, so you can see what your Raspberry Pi is doing.

• Enthusiasm :-)
