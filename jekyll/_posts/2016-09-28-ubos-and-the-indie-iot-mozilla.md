The Mozilla IoT folks invited me ([Johannes Ernst](http://upon2020.com/)) to give a talk at their
[Connected Devices meetup](http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-Connected-Devices-Meetup/)
in San Francisco last night. I talked about "UBOS and the Indie IoT". It features:

* a little bit of UBOS,
* a compare and contrast between Indie IoT and Overlord IoT,
* a high-level market map, and
* how I control my pool from my couch.

Here's the recording:
