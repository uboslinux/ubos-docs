---

<p>We'd love your help. All the UBOS code and the known bugs are on
   <a href="https://github.com/uboslinux/">on github</a>, feel free
   to jump right in!</p>

<p>Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Improve the documentation.

     of open issues</a>.</li>
 <li>Make Mediawiki configuration more flexible.

     of open issues</a>.</li>
 <li>Improve the usability of backup commands.

 <li>Improve some of the UBOS tools.

 <li>New apps and other packages people have requested to run on UBOS.
     Here's <a href="https://github.com/uboslinux/apps-wanted/issues">the list</a>.
     This involves packaging up the app and testing it according to the
     <a href="/docs/developers/app-howto.html">instructions</a> in the
     developer's guide.</li>
 <li>Bring some more useful Wordpress plugins to UBOS.
     <a href="https://github.com/uboslinux/ubos-wordpress">Here are some examples</a> for how to do that.
</ul>
<p>... or whatever else you think would be useful.</p>
<p>Per new Github convention, some of the issues are marked with the tag "good first issue"".
   These are ones expected to be easier to solve for people who are new to UBOS.</p>
